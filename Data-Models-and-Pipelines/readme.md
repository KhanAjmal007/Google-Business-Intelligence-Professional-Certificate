## Overview
In this part of the project, I am expected to use project planning documents to identify key metrics (KPIs) and Dashboard requirements, observe stateholders to better understand how they use data, gather and combine necessary data, and design reporting tables that will be uploaded to Tableau to create the final dashboard. The deliverable for this part of the project is the necessary target tables obtained after following the ETL process. After completing the second course in Google Business Intelligence course, I know how data is stored, transformed and delivered in a BI environment using a data pipeline.

Like previously mentioned, I will be building upon the previous work done during the first course of this certificate to combine data from pre-cleaned tables into one reporting tale that I can use to develop a dashboard for stakeholders. I will begin by uploading the data into the project space using BigQuery, observe how stakeholders interact with the data, and finalizing a reporting table used for the dashboard.

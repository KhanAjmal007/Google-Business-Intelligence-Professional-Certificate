## End-of-Course Project
In the final week of this course, I complete the first part of the Business Intelligence end-of-course project by showcasing my BI knowledge to review relevant project material from stakeholders to identify key requirements, then develop a project requirement document (executive summary) to align with stakeholder needs and guide my project. The key business intelligence documents are as follows:
<ul>
  <li> Stakeholder Requirements </li>
  <li> Project Requirements </li>
  <li> Strategy Documents </li>
</ul>

## Executive Summaries
BI professionals often need to commnicate in order to share plans, updates, and summaries about the project. An executive summary contains documents that contain the most important points in a longer plan or report. An executive summary is used to update decision makers who might be involved in the project or have a stake in the project and the deliverables. 

Executive summaries often present the ideas of a project in a digestable format as to allow an easy-to-understand, most relevant information on the project while also being a useful reference and guide for the overall project outcome. In addition to being for the stakeholders and executives who often make decisions on the project, new team members can be acquainted with the information at a glance. 

Regardless of how they are created or what they contain, executive summaries often include the following:
### Elements
<ul>
  <li> Project Title: A project's theme is incorporated into the executive summary title to create an immediate connection with the target audience </li>
  <li> Hypothesis/Problem Statement: A statement that focuses on the need or concern being targeted or addressed by the project </li>
  <li> Solution: This statement summarizes a projectâ€™s main goal. In this section, actions are described that are intended to address the concerns outlined in the problem statement </li>
  <li> Key insights: The purpose of this section is to provide any additional background and information that may assist the target audience in understanding the project's objectives. Determining what details to include depends heavily on the intended audience. It may also be the case that you choose to include some project reflections. </li>
</ul>

## Summary
Executive summaries are a cohesive way to present information to decision makers, stakeholders, and similar parties which often contain a collection of the most important information within a project or plan of action. While being broader in scope, the executive summary summarizes the status of the project, its discoveries, and whilst describing the problem, proposing a possible solution.
